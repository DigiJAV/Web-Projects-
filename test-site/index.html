    <h1>The Course of Empire - Consummation</h1>
    <p>The walls and columns ring with the noise of crowds, musical instruments, horses and oxen. The sound of fountain water and smells of insense generate a state of calmness to those nearby.
        The celebration of the struggle of generations past and their consummation in the present begins. The following colors are visible in a fountain:
        <ul>
            <li>Blue</li>
            <li>Beige</li>
            <li>Pearl</li>
            <li>Marble</li>
            <li>Obsidian</li>
            <li>Turquoise</li>
            <li>Mustard</li>
            <li>Copper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
